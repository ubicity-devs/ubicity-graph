With Voodoo we explain things. Voodoo aims at putting the <a href="https://github.com/thinkaurelius/titan">Titan graph database</a> under ubicity, depicting social media networks as graphs and running analysis tools on the graphs, in order to draw conclusions on user centrality, local and global network authorities, influence spreading etc. etc. The first component to be developed will be a block causality analysis tool [1]: to detect "blocks" of users within a social network, and analyze [2] the blocks' internal states as consequences of inter-block communications.
